# Docker Build Fix - Frontend npm Dependencies

## Problem
The Docker build was failing with the following error:
```
npm error `npm ci` can only install packages when your package.json and package-lock.json or npm-shrinkwrap.json are in sync. Please update your lock file with `npm install` before continuing.
```

The error occurred because the `package.json` file included dependencies (`dd-trace` and `hot-shots`) that were missing from the `package-lock.json` file, causing the lock file to be out of sync.

## Root Cause
- The `package.json` file contained `dd-trace: ^4.25.0` and `hot-shots: ^10.0.0` dependencies
- These dependencies were not present in the `package-lock.json` file
- The `npm ci` command requires exact synchronization between these files

## Solution Applied
1. **Regenerated package-lock.json**: Ran `npm install` in the frontend directory to update the lock file
2. **Verified dependencies**: Confirmed that both `dd-trace` (v4.55.0) and `hot-shots` (v10.2.1) are now included in the lock file
3. **Used correct Docker Compose command**: Used `docker compose build` instead of `docker-compose build` to avoid version compatibility issues

## Commands Executed
```bash
cd TC/telecomTemp/frontend
npm install  # This added 59 packages and updated package-lock.json

cd TC/telecomTemp
docker compose build frontend  # Using newer syntax
```

## Verification
- The `npm install` command successfully added 59 packages
- Both `dd-trace` and `hot-shots` dependencies are now present in `package-lock.json`
- Docker build is now proceeding without the npm sync error

## Files Modified
- `TC/telecomTemp/frontend/package-lock.json` - Updated with missing dependencies

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETELY RESOLVED** - All issues have been fixed and the entire application stack is running successfully.

## Final Results
All containers are now running and healthy:
- **telecom_backend**: Running on port 5003 (healthy)
- **telecom_frontend**: Running on port 3002 (healthy) 
- **telecom_database**: Running on port 5433 (healthy)
- **telecom_redis**: Running on port 6380 (healthy)
- **telecom_datadog_agent**: Running with APM on port 8127 (healthy)
- **telecom_nginx**: Running on ports 8080/8443 (healthy)

## Additional Port Conflicts Resolved
After fixing the npm issue, we encountered and resolved port conflicts:
- **Redis**: Changed from port 6379 to 6380 (6379 was in use by system Redis)
- **PostgreSQL**: Changed from port 5432 to 5433 (5432 was in use by system PostgreSQL)
